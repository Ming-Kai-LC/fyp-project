=== TRAINING STATUS - 2025-11-19 02:30 ===

ACTIVE TRAINING: ViT-Base
GPU: 100% utilization, 32.3 GB VRAM (66%), 64°C
Progress: Seed 42, Epoch 1 (77% complete)
Model: 85.8M parameters

✅ COMPLETED MODELS (4/6):
1. ResNet-50: 95.45% ± 0.57%
2. DenseNet-121: 95.32% ± 0.26%
3. EfficientNet-B0: 95.23% ± 0.33%
4. CrossViT-Tiny: 94.96% ± 0.55%

🔄 IN PROGRESS:
5. ViT-Base: Training started successfully (fixed img_size issue)
   Estimated time: ~2.5 hours for 5 seeds

⏸️ PENDING:
6. Swin-Tiny: Will train after ViT completes
   Estimated time: ~2 hours for 5 seeds

FIXES APPLIED:
✅ Added img_size=240 parameter to ViT model loading
✅ Added img_size=240 parameter to Swin model loading
✅ Both models now accept 240×240 input images

ESTIMATED COMPLETION:
- ViT-Base: ~05:00 (2.5 hours from now)
- Swin-Tiny: ~07:00 (manually start after ViT)
- All 6 models complete: ~07:00

MONITORING:
# Check ViT progress
tail -f logs/vit_live_training.log

# Check GPU
nvidia-smi

# Start Swin after ViT completes
python train_all_models_safe.py swin

WHAT'S NEXT:
Once ViT completes, you can either:
1. Manually start Swin: python train_all_models_safe.py swin
2. Wait for me to start it automatically
3. Check ViT results and decide

Then you'll have ALL 6 models × 5 seeds = 30 complete training runs!
